# Introduction

We are re-inventing the Large Language Model (LLM). This is the official implementation of [TransNormerLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14995.pdf). Our opened weights of TransNormerLLM are now accessible to individuals, creators, researchers and businesses of all sizes so that they can experiment, innovate and scale their ideas responsibly.

Our release contains the TransNormerLLM model implementation, the open-source weights and the starting code for Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT). We will show examples on how to load [TransNormerLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14995.pdf) models, run SFT and inference on it.

- TransNormerLLM is the first linear attention-based LLM that outperforms conventional softmax attention-based models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. It was trained on a high-quality corpus with up to **1.4 trillion** tokens.
- TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include LRPE positional embedding, Lightning Attention acceleration, new gating and normalization mechanisms.
- TransNormerLLM achieved competitive performance of its size on multiple well-approved Chinese, English, and multi-language general and domain-specific benchmarks.
- This release includes **Base** versions with **385M**, **1B**, and **7B** parameters.
- All versions are fully open to academic research. Developers only need to apply via email and obtain official commercial permission to use it for free commercially.
- For more information, welcome reading our academic paper [TransNormerLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14995.pdf).

# Benchmark Results

To validate TransNormerLLM, we tested our 385M, 1B, and 7B models on Commonsense Reasoning Task, MMLU, CMMLU, and C-Eval. For comparison, we selected several open-source models as competitors, including Transformer-based models such as OPT, Pythia, BLOOM, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, MPT, Falcon, LLaMA1/2, OpenLLAMA v1/v2, Baichuan 1/2, ChatGLM 1/2, and non-Transformer model RWKV. It can be observed that, compared to these models, TransNormerLLM remains highly competitive.

**Commonsense Reasoning** We report BoolQ, PIQA, SIQA,
HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC easy and challenge, OpenBookQA and their average. We report 0-shot results for all benchmarks using LM-Eval-Harness.
All of our models achieve competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art LLMs, showcasing a remarkable ability to comprehend and apply commonsense reasoning.

**Aggregated Benchmarks**
We report the overall results for MMLU, CMMLU, C-Eval. Official scripts were used for evaluating MMLU, CMMLU, and C-Eval, with all evaluation results being conducted with a 5-shot setup. In comparison to top-tier open-source models available in the industry, our models have demonstrated matched performance in both English and Chinese benchmarks.

## General Domain

In the general domain, we conducted 5-shot tests on the following datasets:
- [C-Eval](https://cevalbenchmark.com/index.html#home) is a comprehensive Chinese basic model evaluation dataset, covering 52 disciplines and four levels of difficulty. Our evaluation approach followed that of [LM-Evaluation-Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness).
- [MMLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300) is an English evaluation dataset comprising 57 tasks, encompassing elementary math, American history, computer science, law, etc. The difficulty ranges from high school level to expert level. It's a mainstream LLM evaluation dataset. We used its [official](https://github.com/hendrycks/test) evaluation approach.
- [CMMLU](https://github.com/haonan-li/CMMLU) is a comprehensive Chinese evaluation benchmark covering 67 topics, specifically designed to assess language models' knowledge and reasoning capabilities in a Chinese context. We adopted its [official](https://github.com/haonan-li/CMMLU) evaluation approach.


### Model Results

# Inference and Deployment

The model weights, source code, and configuration needed for inference have been released on Hugging Face. Download links can be found in the table at the beginning of this document. Below, we demonstrate various inference methods using TransNormerLLM-7B-Chat as an example. The program will automatically download the required resources from Hugging Face.

## Dependency Installation

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notice
If you encounter errors related to Triton, please set the following environment variables:
```
export use_triton=False
```


## Python Code Inference

### Demonstration of Base Model Inference

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("OpenNLPLab/TransNormerLLM-1B", trust_remote_code=True)
```

> In the above code snippets, the model loading specifies `device_map='auto'`, which will use all available GPUs. If you need to specify the device(s) to use, you can control it in a way similar to `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1` (using the 0 and 1 graphics cards).


# Fine-tuning the Model

## Dependency Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/TransNormerLLM.git
cd TransNormerLLM/fine-tune
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- To use lightweight fine-tuning methods like LoRA, you must additionally install [peft](https://github.com/huggingface/peft).

## Training

Below, we provide an example of fine-tuning the TransNormerLLM-1B on a single machine with ZeRO-3.

Training Data: `alpaca_data.json`. This sample data was drawn from [alpaca_data.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/main/alpaca_data.json), consisting of a selection of 52,002 entries, and has been reformatted. The main purpose is to demonstrate how to SFT our model, and effectiveness is not guaranteed.

```shell
torchrun \
    --nproc_per_node=8 \
    train.py \
    --model_name_or_path OpenNLPLab/TransNormerLLM-1B \
    --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \
    --output_dir output \
    --num_train_epochs 1 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 2 \

    --evaluation_strategy "no" \
    --save_strategy "steps" \
    --save_steps 5000 \
    --save_total_limit 30 \
    --learning_rate 1e-4 \
    --weight_decay 0.1 \
